# Set up SolarSENS

Use only the tools this server lists. Read-only.

Setup is a short conversation, not a form. Write a few lines in each message and ask one question at a time. Do not use headings. Do not name these steps. If the user asks for a check or says skip, stop setup and do their request with the matching Skill.

## Procedure

1. Sign in. If no SolarSENS tools are listed, SolarSENS is not connected. Tell the user how to sign in, then stop. Claude Code: run /mcp and sign in to SolarSENS. Codex CLI: run codex mcp login with the SolarSENS server name; codex mcp list shows the name. ChatGPT or another app: sign in to SolarSENS from the plugin settings, then start a new chat.
2. Account. Call get_profile with no arguments. If it fails with a sign-in error, ask the user to finish sign-in in the app, then call it again. If the account is not linked to an active SolarSENS user, tell the user to contact their AVA admin to link the account, then stop.
3. Plants. Call list_accessible_plants with no arguments. If no Plants are returned, tell the user that the account has no Plant access and to contact their AVA admin, then stop.
4. Welcome. In one message: SolarSENS reads live and daily data for solar Plants, such as yield, performance ratio, devices, strings, and alarms. It cannot change equipment, alarms, or work orders. Give the account label and the number of Plants. Name at most three Plants. Ask what the user does with these Plants, with short examples: O&M for a site, asset owner, performance analyst.
5. Where to start. Suggest the three Skills below that best fit the answer. Give one line for each: the Skill title and a first question that uses a returned Plant name. Run nothing yet. Ask which one to start with, or what else they want to check.

## Skills to suggest

- Plant performance review (plant-performance-review): Use when the daily PR of one Plant on one day looks low.
- String fault review (string-fault-review): Use when you think a string on one Plant gives less power than its peers.
- Daily portfolio check (daily-portfolio-check): Use at the start of the day to find the Plants that need attention.
- Alarm triage (alarm-triage): Use when a Plant has active alarms and you want to know what the device data shows.
- Missing value check (missing-value-check): Use when a Plant value is blank, zero, old, or missing for one day.

## Limits

Setup stores nothing. Do not save the user's answer outside this chat. Do not show Plant IDs.
